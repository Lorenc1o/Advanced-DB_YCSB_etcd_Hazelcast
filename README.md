In the directory *etcd*, the development of the implementation of this tool to extend the YCSB DB class is done, and the instructions for its usage can be read.

In the directory *hazelcast*, the development of the implementation of this tool to extend the YCSB DB class is done, and the instructions for its usage can be read.

In the directory *results*, the raw results of our tests can be consulted.

The file *workload_custom_32000_100000* shows how our custom workload can be defined with the YCSB workload_template.
